# Job search

It’s finally time to get your job hunt started!

Here are some things you can do to support the process and get the most out of it.

## Interview skills

Like everything in life, interviewing gets easier as you practice it. Your first interviews should ideally be with companies that are not at the top of your wish list. Keep the most interesting ones from the third interview onwards.

Take these steps in the meantime to hone your skills:

- **Watch how to approach a coding interview**, through these two examples from [Amazon](https://youtu.be/zGv3hOORxh0) and [Google](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw).
- **Check your preparation** with this [collection of common JavaScript Front-End reference questions](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook).
- **Scroll through this book**: “[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhs8r98f1qf62ug/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview.pdf?dl=0)”. Especially check the first few sections.

During the next few weeks, keep practicing and improving your whiteboarding skills more or less daily, until you sign an offer. There are many platforms to do this. As a perk, if you sign up on [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) through [this link](https://coderbyte.com/sl?signupPromo=codeworks-practice-463463) you get free unlimited access for 3 months (if you already signed up during our intro course, you need to delete your account first, or sign up for a new one with a different email).

Independently of the platform(s) that you choose, find what level of challenges you can solve, and then try to go a step up.

In a real interview, make sure to communicate well with the interviewer.

- Before you start solving an exercise, to check that you’ve understood the requirements well.
- While you implement a solution, to explain your line of thinking.
- After you’re done, to comment on the trade-offs you made and what can be improved.

Try this at home a few times, speaking out loud as you practice some exercises, to get used to it.

## Organization

As you apply to many companies it’s easy to lose track of when you last interacted with them, what is the status of your application, and what you should do next.

With a good system, you can become an interview ninja:

- **Write down your goals**. Take five minutes to write down what are your goals in this job search. You can update them if you change your mind along the way, but it's very useful to have a reference.
- **Keep yourself organized**. Track all your applications and their status using the spreadsheet that you will receive today from our Outcomes Team.
- **Build a routine**. Apply every day to 5 companies that sound interesting to you, until you get interesting offers on the table. Do it every morning as your first task, for example from 9 to 10 am (start form today!). Being methodical and rewarding yourself afterwards really pays off.

In case your job applications requires a cover letter, you can find a starting template in the `./examples` folder.

## Communities

Tech communities can be very useful in your job search. They usually have a job channel where users post job opportunities at their companies. Make sure you join and introduce yourself in the introductions channel with something like:

> Hi everyone! I’m [name]. I’ve just graduated from Codeworks [city] [if remote just say “Codeworks”], which was pretty insane: 11h a day, Monday to Saturday, for 3 months. I’m currently looking for software engineering roles
> 
> I’ve worked with technologies such as [mention some technologies]. You can check out my profiles here, feel free to get in touch if interested:
> 
> https://github.com/[username]
> https://linkedin.com/in/[username]

Make sure you find a way to add value to the community instead of just self-promoting.

## Side projects

Whenever you get tired of practicing interview skills, applying to companies, or going to interviews, here are a couple useful things you should do during these days:

- **Add automated tests** to your senior projects. In case they already have some, extend the test coverage. As always, start with unit tests, and once you have a good base consider adding end-to-end tests.
- **Add features** to your senior projects. These are the last few days that you can get direct support from instructors and work full-time with your team. Take advantage of it to ship your project and deploy it online, while implementing the functionality at the top of your backlog.
